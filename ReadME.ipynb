    "## Assginment\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's assignment, we are going to explore how different objects behave under different symmetry operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you should have a clear understanding of how different symmetry operations affect physical quantities such as scalars, vectors, and pseudoscalars, and an approach to implementing these operations using Python and numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetry is a fundamental concept in physics. If a system obeys certain symmetries, the mathematical models that we use to describe it must also obey those symmetries. Every time you have written down the equation for the energy of a system, or the force acting on a system, there has been an implicit appeal to your innate understanding of symmetry, or what has been developed in your experience in the world, or education in physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 'one-dimensional objects'\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we are going to define 'one-dimensional objects' with vector operators, and use special symmetries to make sense of them. The four objects we are going to explore are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. scalar\n",
    "2. pseudoscalar\n",
    "3. polar vector\n",
    "4. axial (pseudo) vector\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct these objects out of Cartesian vectors (you may want these defined as numpy arrays to help with the assignment):\n",
    "\n",
    "- a = [1, 0, 0]\n",
    "- b = [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "- c = [0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The symmetry operations\n",
    "\n",
    "With these vectors defined, we can define the four objects, all aligned along the z-axis of a three-dimensional Cartesian space, by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. scalar: np.dot(c, c) # dot product\n",
    "2. pseudoscalar: np.dot(c, np.cross(a, b)) # scalar triple product\n",
    "3. polar vector: c # no operation\n",
    "4. axial (pseudo) vector np.cross(a, b) # cross product\n",
    "\n",
    "### 'Even' and 'odd'\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that an object is *even* under a symmetry transformation if it does not change sign under the symmetry operation. The object is said to *odd* under a symmetry transformation if it changes sign. This is most easily seen by working with the polar vector `c = [0, 0, 1]`. We can imagine an arrow pointing up. If we, for example, perform a mirror operation for a mirror oriented in the xy-plane, the arrow would be pointing down. This is the same as if we multiplied `c` by `-1`. `c` is said to be *odd* under this mirror operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example of applying a symmetry operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for example the two following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "identity = np.array(\n",
    "         [[ 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "         ,[ 0, 1, 0]\n",
    "         ,[ 0, 0, 1]]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to the four objects is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "id_scalar = np.dot(identity @ c, identity @ c)\n",
    "id_pseudo_scalar = np.dot(identity @ c, np.cross(identity @ a, identity @ b))\n",
    "id_polar_vec = identity @ c\n",
    "id_axial_vec = np.cross(identity @ a, identity @ b)\n",
    "\n",
    "Which, of course, has no effect. We have found the trivial relation that all of these objects are unchanged by the identity operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The symmetry operations; assignment instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the following operations and find if the four objects are even or odd about these operations. Compile your results in a Jupyter Notebook called `symmetry.ipynb`. Include notes for yourself, explaining your approach, and python cells showing your computational work. Include a table in MarkDown with your results at the end of the notebook (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations are (I have defined the inversion operation for you):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inversion = np.array(\n",
    "               [[-1,  0,  0]\n",
    "               ,[ 0, -1,  0]\n",
    "               ,[ 0,  0, -1]]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- mirror_z: a mirror in the xy-plane\n",
    "- mirror_x: a mirror in the yz-plane\n",
    "- rotation_x_180: a 180 degree rotation about the x-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to create a table with markdown in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a table in markdown, you can use `|` to separate columns, and `-` to create horizontal lines. For example, I have started the table here:\n",
    "\n",
    "| 1D object    | identity | inversion | mirror_z | mirror_y | rotation_x_180 |\n",
    "|--------------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| scalar       | 1        |           |          |          |                |\n",
    "| pseudoscalar | 1        |           |          |          |                |\n",
    "| polar vector | 1        |           |          |          |                |\n",
    "| axial vector | 1        |           |          |          |                |\n",
    "\n",
    "Are any of these operators redundant?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the system has these symmetries, The energy must be even under all of these symmetries. Assume that we have the following assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q_1 : scalar\n",
    "Q_2 : pseudoscalar\n",
    "Q_3 : polar vector\n",
    "Q_3 = axial vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the square of any of these terms, i.e. Q_i^2, is even under all of the symmetry operations. This is a generalization of the multiplication rules \"even times even is even\" and \"odd times odd is even\" for each symmetry. You can think about this as a sping-mass system where the energy stored in the spring is 1/2 k x^2. Each Q_i is the coordinate of a mass, and 1/2 k is whatever the coefficient of that is that gives us units of energy. Are any terms Q_i * Q_j possible? Why or why not? What about Q_i * Q_j * Q_k? These terms, if they exists, tell us how these \"springs\" can be coupled to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For those interested: Space-Time extension\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept can be extended to space-time by adding an additional operation `time-reversal` and treating every object as being a 4-vector where the first element is `c*t`. Then there are five new operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identity + time-reversal\n",
    "- inversion + time-reversal\n",
    "- mirror_z + time-reversal\n",
    "- mirror_y + time-reversal\n",
    "- rotation_x_180 + time-reversal\n",
    "\n",
    "and the objects become\n",
    "\n",
    "- time-even scalar\n",
    "- time-even pseudoscalar\n",
    "- time-even polar-vector\n",
    "- time-even axial vector\n",
    "- time-odd scalar\n",
    "- time-odd pseudoscalar\n",
    "- time-odd polar-vector\n",
    "- time-odd axial vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there new Q_i * Q_j * Q_k terms allowed now? Are there patterns that you notice?\n",
    "\n",
